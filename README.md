### Steps to run

1. In your terminal, navigate to your `code` (or any) folder
3. [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
4. Pull the dependencies by typing `npm install`
5. Run the code with `node index.js` or, after you've ran `npm install nodemon --global`, run `nodemon index.js` so that your server restart when you make changes
6. Go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your browser 

#### Navigating terminal:
 * Shortcuts: 
 * `pwd` -> shows you where you are 
 * `cd ..` -> go down one level in your file system
 * `ls` -> list all the folders and files in your immediate folder
 * `cd $fileFolderName` -> step into a folder (don't use the `$`), one example is `cd code` (if you have the code folder)
